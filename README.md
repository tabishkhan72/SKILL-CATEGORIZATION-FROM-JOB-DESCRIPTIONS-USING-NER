# **🔍 Skill Extraction from Job Descriptions using NLP and BERT**

## **📌 Overview**  
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **BERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to **extract and classify skills** from job descriptions. The goal is to **automate skill identification** by recognizing **soft skills** and **technical skills** in job postings using **BIO-tagging** and a **fine-tuned BERT model**

## **🚀 Features**  

✔ **Automated Skill Extraction** – Detects both **technical** and **soft skills** in job descriptions  
✔ **Fine-tuned BERT Model** – Optimized for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** on job-related text  
✔ **Comprehensive Skills Taxonomy** – Incorporates **O*NET skills database** and **web-scraped job postings**  
✔ **Intelligent Matching** – Recognizes **synonyms and variations** (e.g., "Machine Learning Engineer" → "ML Engineer")

## **📊 Dataset Details**  

- **📂 Job Descriptions Dataset** – 187,853 **web-scraped job descriptions**.  
- **🆔 Unique Identification** – Each job description is assigned a **Job ID**.  
- **📝 Data Columns**:  
  - **Job Description** – Detailed text about each role.  
  - **Skills** – Extracted skills required for the job.  

- **🗂 Skills Database** – 8,904 **skills extracted from onetonline.org**, including:  
  - **35 Soft Skills** (e.g., leadership, communication).  
  - **8,869 Technical Skills** (e.g., Python, Kubernetes).
